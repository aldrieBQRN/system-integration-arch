My expectations for the System Integration and Architecture subject are to learn how to build complex systems by connecting different parts. I hope to understand the best ways to link software and hardware, and I want to learn about different design styles like microservices. My main goal is to gain practical skills to create systems that are not just functional, but also strong and easy to maintain.
I expect this course to teach me how to solve the problem of getting different technologies to work together. I want to learn about the tools used for communication between systems, like APIs and message queues. I also want to know how to choose the right method for a specific project, considering things like speed and security. Ultimately, I want to be able to make sure all parts of a system work together smoothly.
Finally, I believe this subject will teach me what a system architect does. I hope to learn how to create clear diagrams and documents that explain a system's design to others. This subject should help me think about a system's entire life, from its beginning to its future growth. My overall expectation is to learn how to look at the big picture of software development, focusing on the system's overall health and structure rather than just its individual components.
